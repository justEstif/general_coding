Form validation using JS's constraint validation api

- for simpler form validation you can use HTML5 field validation

'novalidation' attr to form to stop the browser's default validation

The Constraint Validation API

- provides customization options which can enhance or modify standard HTML5
  field checking behavior.

Steps:

1. disable default form validation
   > add `novalidate` in html form or
   > add form.noValidate = true
2. Add form event handlers

I think the way I used object to get the inputs and spans was good.
