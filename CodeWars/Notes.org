#+title: Code Wars

+ General Guideline to Problem Solving
  - Understand and explain the problem to a duck
  - Plan
  - Pseudocode and research applicable functions
  - Divide and Conquer

* Convert string to camel case
- Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing.
- The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).
#+begin_example
"the-stealth-warrior" -> "theStealthWarrior"
"The_Stealth_Warrior" -> "TheStealthWarrior"
#+end_example
- Solving:
  + function takes in a string and capitalies every word that comes after '-' or '_'
