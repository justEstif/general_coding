# Application Data

- we can set up a database or,
- we can use local storeage to retrieve data when web apps start

## Local storage

- gives us a way to store or restrieve data
- we can store on the data locally in the browser and retreive it when needed
  - we can access the data and load it back into the web app
- it is provided by the browser

- localStorage:

  - has length property: how many items we have stored
  - and other methods in the prototype

- each value stored has to be a string
- we have to parse the string before we use it in the program
